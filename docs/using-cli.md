# Using Jupytext at the command line

## Command line conversion

The package provides a `jupytext` script for command line conversion between the various notebook extensions:

```bash
jupytext --to py notebook.ipynb                 # create a notebook.py file in the light format
jupytext --to py:percent notebook.ipynb         # create a notebook.py file in the double percent format
jupytext --to py:percent --comment-magics false notebook.ipynb   # create a notebook.py file in the double percent format, and do not comment magic commands
jupytext --to markdown notebook.ipynb           # create a notebook.md file
jupytext --output script.py notebook.ipynb      # create a script.py file

jupytext --to notebook notebook.py              # overwrite notebook.ipynb (remove outputs)
jupytext --to notebook --update notebook.py     # update notebook.ipynb (preserve outputs)
jupytext --to ipynb notebook1.md notebook2.py   # overwrite notebook1.ipynb and notebook2.ipynb

jupytext --to md --test notebook.ipynb          # Test round trip conversion

jupytext --to md --output - notebook.ipynb      # display the markdown version on screen
jupytext --from ipynb --to py:percent           # read ipynb from stdin and write double percent script on stdout
```

Jupytext has a `--sync` mode that updates all the paired representations of a notebook based on the file that was last modified. You may also find useful to `--pipe` the text representation of a notebook into tools like `black`:
```bash
jupytext --sync --pipe black notebook.ipynb    # read most recent version of notebook, reformat with black, save
```

The `jupytext` command accepts many arguments. Use the `--set-formats` and the `--update-metadata` arguments to edit the pairing information or more generally the notebook metadata. Execute `jupytext --help` to access the documentation.

## Jupytext as a Git pre-commit hook

Jupytext is also available as a Git pre-commit hook. Use this if you want Jupytext to create and update the `.py` (or `.md`...) representation of the staged `.ipynb` notebooks. All you need is to create an executable `.git/hooks/pre-commit` file with the following content:
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# For every ipynb file in the git index, add a Python representation
jupytext --from ipynb --to py:light --pre-commit
```

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# For every ipynb file in the git index:
# - apply black and flake8
# - export the notebook to a Python script in folder 'python'
# - and add it to the git index
jupytext --from ipynb --pipe black --check flake8 --pre-commit
jupytext --from ipynb --to python//py:light --pre-commit
```

If you don't want notebooks to be committed (and only commit the representations), you can ask the pre-commit hook to unstage notebooks after conversion by adding the following line:
```bash
git reset HEAD **/*.ipynb
```
Note that these hooks do not update the `.ipynb` notebook when you pull. Make sure to either run `jupytext` in the other direction, or to use our paired notebook and our contents manager for Jupyter. Also, Jupytext does not offer a merge driver. If a conflict occurs, solve it on the text representation and then update or recreate the `.ipynb` notebook. Or give a try to nbdime and its [merge driver](https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/stable/vcs.html#merge-driver).

## Testing the round-trip conversion

Representing Jupyter notebooks as scripts requires a solid round trip conversion. You don't want your notebooks (nor your scripts) to be modified because you are converting them to the other form. Our test suite includes a few hundred tests to ensure that round trip conversion is safe.

You can easily test that the round trip conversion preserves your Jupyter notebooks and scripts. Run for instance:
```bash
# Test the ipynb -> py:percent -> ipynb round trip conversion
jupytext --test notebook.ipynb --to py:percent

# Test the ipynb -> (py:percent + ipynb) -> ipynb (à la paired notebook) conversion
jupytext --test --update notebook.ipynb --to py:percent
```

Note that `jupytext --test` compares the resulting notebooks according to its expectations. If you wish to proceed to a strict comparison of the two notebooks, use `jupytext --test-strict`, and use the flag `-x` to report with more details on the first difference, if any.

Please note that
- Scripts opened with Jupyter have a default [metadata filter](using-server.html#metadata-filtering) that prevents additional notebook or cell
metadata to be added back to the script. Remove the filter if you want to store Jupytext's settings, or the kernel information, in the text file.
- Cell metadata are available in the `light` and `percent` formats, as well as in the Markdown and R Markdown formats. R scripts in `spin` format support cell metadata for code cells only. Sphinx Gallery scripts in `sphinx` format do not support cell metadata.
- By default, a few cell metadata are not included in the text representation of the notebook. And only the most standard notebook metadata are exported. Learn more on this in the sections for [notebook specific](using-server.html#per-notebook-configuration) and [global settings](using-server.html#metadata-filtering) for metadata filtering.

## Reading notebooks in Python

You can also manipulate notebooks in a Python shell or script using Jupytext's main functions:

```python
# Read a notebook from a file. Format can be any of 'py', 'md', 'jl:percent', ...
readf(nb_file, fmt=None)

# Read a notebook from a string. Here, format should contain at least the file extension.
reads(text, fmt)

# Return the text representation for a notebook in the desired format.
writes(notebook, fmt)

# Write a notebook to a file in the desired format.
writef(notebook, nb_file, fmt=None)
```
